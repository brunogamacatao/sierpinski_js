# Simple Sierpinski Triangle Generator

Just saw an Youtube video teaching an algorith to draw, by hand, a Sierpinski Triangle based on three simple rules:

1. draw three points;
2. choose randomly one of the three original points;
3. choose randomly another point;
4. draw a new point on the middle of those two points;
5. repeat from the step 2.
